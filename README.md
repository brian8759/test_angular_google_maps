Aim:
Test angular_google_maps.js

https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/


I am trying to visualize data getting from MongoDB with Goolge Maps API.
Those data are in JSON format. They are Geo locations.

However, I found it is not easy to combine Angular.js with Google map API.
Then I found this resource. 
I need to test it and play with it a little.
